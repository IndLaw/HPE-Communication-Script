  <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Office of Health, Safety, and Physical Education is requesting that
    <strong><u>each school complete the provided inventory document by June 16th, 2024</u></strong>; we will send
    reminders
    periodically. We are asking that each school provide an inventory of items purchased through the school's budget so
    we can better advocate for quality physical education programming. Items that have been acquired through personal
    efforts or personal purchases should not be added to the list; For example, items acquired through Donors Choose or
    Leveling the Playing Field should be kept off the inventory sheet. Use the attached Google document to record your
    inventory. If you are having difficulties, please refer to the attached video or reach out to the office.
  </p>
